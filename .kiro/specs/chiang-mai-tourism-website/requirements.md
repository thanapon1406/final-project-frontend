# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves designing and developing a tourism website for Chiang Mai that showcases tourist attractions and activities. The website will serve as a comprehensive platform for visitors to discover various types of tourist destinations in Chiang Mai, including cultural sites, natural attractions, wellness locations, and festivals. The system will include both a public-facing frontend for tourists and an administrative backend for content management, with data stored in JSON files and integrated with mapping services.

## Reference Website Analysis

### Selected Reference Website
**Website:** https://huaytuengthao.com/
**Description:** Tourism website for Huay Tueng Thao, a popular tourist attraction in Chiang Mai featuring natural scenery, recreational activities, and visitor services.

### Design Analysis of Reference Website

**Positive Aspects:**
1. **Clean Bootstrap Implementation**: Uses Bootstrap 5.1.3 with responsive design and proper grid system
2. **Effective Visual Hierarchy**: Clear navigation, prominent carousel slider, and well-organized content sections
3. **Thai Language Support**: Proper implementation of Itim font for Thai text readability
4. **Interactive Elements**: Functional carousel, news marquee, and embedded social media content
5. **Consistent Branding**: Unified color scheme and visual identity throughout the site

### Three Key Areas for Design Improvement

#### 1. Limited Content Scalability
**Current Issue:** The website is designed for a single tourist attraction with static content structure
**Improvement Needed:** Develop a scalable system that can accommodate multiple attractions with dynamic content management, category filtering, and search functionality

#### 2. Basic Information Architecture
**Current Issue:** Simple navigation structure with limited content organization and no advanced filtering options
**Improvement Needed:** Implement comprehensive categorization system (Cultural, Natural, Wellness, Festivals) with advanced search and filtering capabilities for better content discovery

#### 3. Lack of Interactive Features
**Current Issue:** Limited user interaction beyond basic navigation and carousel browsing
**Improvement Needed:** Add interactive elements such as attraction comparison, favorites system, user reviews, and enhanced map integration with multiple location markers

### Information Grouping and Sitemap Design

#### Content Categories
1. **Cultural Attractions**: Temples, museums, historical sites, cultural centers
2. **Natural Attractions**: Parks, waterfalls, mountains, gardens, scenic viewpoints  
3. **Wellness Tourism**: Spas, meditation centers, wellness retreats, traditional massage
4. **Festivals & Events**: Cultural festivals, seasonal events, local celebrations
5. **Adventure Activities**: Outdoor sports, trekking, water activities
