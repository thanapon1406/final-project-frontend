# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves redesigning the existing Huay Tueng Thao tourism website (https://huaytuengthao.com/) to create a more modern and visually appealing version. The redesigned website will maintain the same content and structure as the original site but with improved UX/UI design using Bootstrap and jQuery. All existing content from the original website will be extracted and stored in organized JSON files, allowing for dynamic content management through an administrative backend system.

## Reference Website Analysis

### Selected Reference Website
**Website:** https://huaytuengthao.com/
**Description:** Tourism website for Huay Tueng Thao, a popular tourist attraction in Chiang Mai featuring natural scenery, recreational activities, and visitor services.

### Design Analysis of Reference Website

**Positive Aspects:**
1. **Clean Bootstrap Implementation**: Uses Bootstrap 5.1.3 with responsive design and proper grid system
2. **Effective Visual Hierarchy**: Clear navigation, prominent carousel slider, and well-organized content sections
3. **Thai Language Support**: Proper implementation of Itim font for Thai text readability
4. **Interactive Elements**: Functional carousel, news marquee, and embedded social media content
5. **Consistent Branding**: Unified color scheme and visual identity throughout the site

### Three Key Areas for Design Improvement

#### 1. Visual Hierarchy and Content Organization
**Current Design Issue:** The website uses a single-column content layout with limited visual separation between different types of information, making it difficult for users to quickly scan and find relevant content
**Design Improvement:** Implement better visual hierarchy using card-based layouts, improved typography scaling, and strategic use of whitespace to create clear content sections that guide users' attention to important information

#### 2. Color Scheme and Brand Identity
**Current Design Issue:** The website relies heavily on Bootstrap's default dark theme without a distinctive color palette that reflects Huay Tueng Thao's natural beauty and tourism identity
**Design Improvement:** Develop a cohesive color scheme that incorporates warm, nature-inspired colors that reflect the location's natural beauty and peaceful atmosphere, while maintaining good contrast ratios for accessibility

#### 3. Mobile-First Responsive Design
**Current Design Issue:** While the site uses Bootstrap's responsive features, the design doesn't prioritize mobile user experience with touch-friendly interactions and mobile-optimized content presentation
**Design Improvement:** Redesign the interface with mobile-first approach, featuring larger touch targets, simplified navigation for small screens, and optimized image galleries that work seamlessly across all device sizes

### Information Grouping and Content Organization

#### Content Organization (Based on Existing Website Structure)
1. **Homepage Content**: Carousel slides, service sections, featured content, news updates
2. **History Section**: Historical background and development of Huay Tueng Thao
3. **Services Information**: Available activities and facilities at the location
4. **News & Updates**: Announcements and recent developments
5. **About Information**: General information about the location
6. **Contact Details**: Address, phone numbers, social media links, location map
